You can change the picture used in the puzzle!
here are the steps to do so:

1. Trim your picture into 8 square/tiles (same height and width) sub-pictures
   you can use any tool for that!. 
   Make sure that you save them in a ".png" format.

2. Rename the 8  newly created pictures as follow: 
	- The 1st (top-left) tile to "img-01"
	- The 2nd (top-middle) tile to "img-02"
	- ...
	- The 7th (bottom-middle) tile to "img-07"
	- and the 8th (botton-rigth) tile ro "img-08"
	
	Here's a representation of the picture with 
	different tiles numbers:
	+---------+---------+---------+
	|	  |	    |	      |
	|    1	  |    2    |    3    |
	|	  |	    |	      |
	+---------+---------+---------+
	|	  |	    |	      |
	|    4	  |    5    |    6    |
	|	  |	    |	      |
	+---------+---------+---------+
	|	  |	    |	      |
	|    7	  |    8    |    9    |
	|	  |	    |	      |
	+---------+---------+---------+
